<< It's a simple python script that will use openai bot to answer as close as possible to chatgpt


>> How to use ?

<< First, install requirements (see install below), then, simple run install.sh. It should now be able to run using 'chatgpt' command


>> How to install everything ?

<< That is the tricky part. I don't have the ability to make an installer compatible with every platform (fedroa, ubuntu...) because of flemme, so I'll leave this help.

    1) Install (with your package manager, dnf, apt-get...) python3 and python3-pip (or search the god damn google to find how to do that)

    2) Login / register to https://openai.com/login, generate an API key (by clicking your profile, "View API Keys", and generating a new one (copy it !)), and paste it on the TOKEN file.

    3) Everything is now ready, you can run the install.sh


>> How tu use once I'me in ?
